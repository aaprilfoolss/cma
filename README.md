CMA Visualization -- React App

This project is an exploration of React, as I wanted to introduce myself to the framework.

On the webpage, you'll see a visual representation of the Cleveland Museum of Art's collection, colored according to the work's creation date. To achieve this, the Cleveland Museum of Art Open Access API was used (found here: https://openaccess-api.clevelandart.org/). The API call returns a maximum of 1000 records, and I iterated through this return object to create each colored square. Along the bottom, you'll find a legend dictating the period of time associated with each color.
